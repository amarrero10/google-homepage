This is my first project with the Odin project. Still not very familiar with Git but I am hoping that it won't be challenging to get used to. This project consists of making a copy of the Google homepage. Semms pretty good for a beginner project. I finally completed my project. It took me sometime and it may be sloppy , but I can only get better.
